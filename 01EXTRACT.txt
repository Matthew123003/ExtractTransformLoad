ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. An ETL tool extracts the 
data from different RDBMS source systems, transforms the data like 
applying calculations, concatenate, etc. and then load the data to Data
 Warehouse system. The data is loaded in the DW system in the form of 
 dimension and fact tables.


Extraction

    A staging area is required during ETL load. There are various 
    reasons why staging area is required.

    The source systems are only available for specific period of time 
    to extract data. This period of time is less than the total data-load
     time. Therefore, staging area allows you to extract the data from
      the source system and keeps it in the staging area before the time
       slot ends.

    Staging area is required when you want to get the data from multiple
     data sources together or if you want to join two or more systems
      together. For example, you will not be able to perform a SQL query
       joining two tables from two physically different databases.

    Data extractionsâ€™ time slot for different systems vary as per the
     time zone and operational hours.

    Data extracted from source systems can be used in multiple data
     warehouse system, Operation Data stores, etc.

    ETL allows you to perform complex transformations and requires 
    extra area to store the data.

# ExtractTransformLoad

This was created to not only have notes and practice on ETL.

I have written a small ETL program using SpringBoot, Maven, ZooKeeper, and Kafka.

The ReactNative front end was added to expand the project at a later date and transform it into a full stack application to gain practice of making API calls for certain actions from the front end to the backend. 
That will be added at a later date.

I now fully understand Extract, Transform, and Load. I also have notes
about the process in this project along with notes on ZooKeeper and Kafka. 

Furthermore I understand Kafka and how it works as well.

This project is just a start of what it could become with time and I plan on revisiting this in the future to not only learn more about everything this project encompasses but also add in more new technologies that I want to learn about.
